## Overview

Build a Portfolio Website is the second project of [Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). In this project student is challenged to apply what he/she have learned of HTML and CSS to transform [a design mock-up](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) into a functioning responsive website complete with images, text descriptions and links.



Here's the [Udacity's mock-up](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) preview for this project:
